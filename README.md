Abstract :

A lot of people dream of building their own home but they do not have full knowledge of the subject. We are going to make an application that will guide our users and provide all the information they need to get started with. Our application will also assist our users in the construction of their home. It connects Customers and the contractors according to customer’s demand.

On our application,Contractors would have a profile and customers will be able to view them and book them. Customers would also have their own profile and they would also be able to view the completion status of their home on their dashboard. Customers can get an estimation of the total cost and time needed to complete their home, based on their land area, floors, building materials used, and the decoration they prefer. Moreover, users are also able to view new housing schemes and offers/sales available. Our whole application would be managed and updated by the admin staff who would also be the domain experts. Customers would also book a meeting with experts. Customers would also be able to rate the contractors. Customers and contractors would also have the feature of updating their profiles like updating login credentials. A catalog would be available on our application where all contractors will be shown. There would be a special discount for our regular customers, the customers would be able to book our contractors at cheaper rates. A feature of filtering contractors based on rating and prices would also be available for our user base.
